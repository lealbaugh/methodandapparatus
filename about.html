	<b>Method & Apparatus</b> is an e-zine on the use of free/cheap/accessible tools to create works of digital art. The idea is to publish creations along with some documentation of the creative process that led to them, in the spirit of the scientific practice of reproducibility. Think of it as pairing a film release with its &ldquo;making of&rdquo; (on a much much smaller scale).
